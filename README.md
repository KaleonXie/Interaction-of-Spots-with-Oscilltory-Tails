# Interaction-of-Spots-with-Oscilltory-Tails

Codes for the paper `` Dynamics of N-spot rings with oscillatory tails in a three-component reaction-diffusion system'' 


Run "Stationary_N_spot_ring_Solver.m" to get a stationary N-spot ring. You change the variable spots_num to set the N.

Run "Traveling_N_spot_ring_Solver.m" to get a traveling N-spot ring. The initial condition is set as the solution obtained by "Stationary_N_spot_ring_Solver.m" plus an initial velocity.

Run "Rotating_N_spot_ring_Solver.m" to get a rotating N-spot ring. The initial condition is set as the solution obtained by "Stationary_N_spot_ring_Solver.m" plus an initial rotating velocity.


Some movies of the dynamics produced by the code are as follows:
